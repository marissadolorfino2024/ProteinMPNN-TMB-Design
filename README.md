# ProteinMPNN-TMB-Design

Code for ProteinMPNN TMB Design paper

- The scripts directory includes scripts for designing sequences using ProteinMPNN, folding structures with AlphaFold2, relaxing structures using Rosetta, and generating RaptorX secondary structure predictions. It also contains scripts for analyzing designed sequences and structures.

- The analysis_data directory includes csv files containing the results from our analysis of ProteinMPNN and Franklin2023 beta-barrel designs.
